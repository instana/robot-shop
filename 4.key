There are 300 files and 45 folders in the entire repo.

dhar-arm: vidyadhar$ cd robot-shop
dhar-arm:robot-shop vidyadhar$ ls -lR | grep ^d | wc -l
      45
dhar-arm:robot-shop vidyadhar$ ls -lR | wc -l
     345

In Unix/Linux everything is treated as a file. So 'ls -lR' includes all the files and folders in the repo. Subtracting 45 from 345 gives the file count.
